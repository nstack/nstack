# Guidelines

## Contributor Agreement
A pull-request will only be considered for merging into the upstream codebase after you have signed our [contributor agreement] (https://github.com/nstack/nstack/blob/master/Contributor%20Agreement.md), assigning us the rights to the contributed code and granting you a license to use it in return. If you submit a pull request, you will be prompted to review and sign the agreement with one click (we use [CLA assistant] (https://cla-assistant.io/)).
