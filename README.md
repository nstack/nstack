# NStack: Type-safe, composable microservices for data analytics

NStack is a data analytics platform which makes productionising data-driven code in the cloud and connecting it to data sources really simple. It provides a way to transform local code on your machine into functions which live on your cloud provider. These can be connected to data and event-sources using NStack's scripting language, and NStack automates all infrastructure. NStack can be used for productionising data-science models, data integration, or simply to build microservices.

NStack is platform-agnostic, which means it can can run anywhere, from your laptop, to your company's cloud provider.
